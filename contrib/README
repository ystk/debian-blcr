Contents of the contrib directory

* batch_build.in
  This is source for contrib/batch_build, which is built at configure time.
  The resulting script can be invoked with a list of kernel build directories
  and will attempt to build BLCR against each of the listed kernels.  A
  significant part of the code deals with the /boot/kernel.h mechanism used
  by Red Had Linux 8 and 9 (among other distributions).

* blcr.magic
  This is file type detection data for the file(1), as described in the
  magic(5) manpage.  In most cases adding this to /etc/magic will allow
  the file(1) utility to identify BLCR's context files.  However, you
  should consult your file(1) and magic(5) manpages to determine the
  proper location for your own installation.

* cr_depmod
  This is a perl script we use as a replacement for the depmod(8)
  utility.  It is not a full replacement: it only checks for unresolved
  symbol references.  We wrote this because the depmod(8) interface
  changed on us a couple times.

* cr_insmod.in
  This is source for contrib/cr_insmod, which is built at configure time.
  It used to contain a script to load the appropriate kernel modules.
  Now that function is in BLCR's top-level Makefile, and this script is
  now just a one-liner to invoke make.

* gen_cscope.in
  This is source for contrib/gen_scope, which is built at configure time.
  We use the resulting script to contruct a cscope(1) database of the
  combined BLCR and kernel sources.
